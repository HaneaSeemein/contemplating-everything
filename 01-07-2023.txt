this one for my friends who think AI can be conscious or even be 100% sucessful in predicting your behavior, if it can really really predict your
behavior with 100% accuracy it might as well be able to switch your universes. And also machines can never have a freedom of choice. To begin with 
what is random even? rolling a dice, pulling out a card and all are only lack of information and you consider it to be random bcs you want to, but 
what truely is random is your dance maybe nobody really knows your next move you always have choice for your actions no matter how strict you are with 
your dance moves or someting there will always be a choice for you to do something differently maybe even a little bootyshake nobody can really know 
you, and this random actions the freedom you have to choose anything is consciousness, the infinite possibilities that you create for so many occurances
is so magical, for any other so called random events the outcomes can be (easily) predicted given all the involved factors yes? and how things work 
and you are not dumb you can simply calculate the outcome with 100% accuracy but for predicting your behavior maybe you did train a super cool expensive 
super awesome and best in the world AI model in the universe to predict your walking style it might be close to how you walk but you randomly pull out 
a weird move or choose to do something differently it will fail there, similary for any action not just the walk but also your recommendations can't 
really recommend anything with 100% accuracy they can be 99.999..99% accurate but never 100%. Well some might say the model can also be trained for 
choosing the most probable random action you can take but NO. I dont want to explain but no and trust me w this pls. yeah so back to truely random,
what you call random is nothing random, it is just a sequence of complicated actions(that you dont want to know) to create one outcome, like for a 
dice given all factors like the initial torque, gravity, air pressure, position the final outcome is absolutely predictable and for the random number 
genrators that we have now are afterall stupidly processed from some factors might be time, temperature, location or number of fish in the sea can be 
anything but these factors are certain and definite they are only trying to process these factors with an algorithm as 'random' as possible to give a 
number what you call as random. also when pass same parameters for the algorithm it will give you the same result which is the simple way declaring it 
not random. So a conscious mind is so random you might think of idli out of nowhere, hence to generate a 100% AI machine it is 100% impossible bcs 
it can never generate a random number it can never even be truely consciously although it can imitate closely but never conscious, ie if you train 
two models with the same fricking parameters both will behave the same way and that is so not random and conscious, well the closest you can get to 
randomness is by training a model with infinite number of embedded nueral networks and infinite is infinite so yk not possible, not just this conscious
mind has INFINITE possibilities for every choice which again is not possible so never argue about AI consciousness because i am tired and done explaining 
this, also if you generate a supercomputer that keeps record of an AI socalled conscious machine, it can be used to manipulate the AI and stuff lmao 
so relax the matrix and all those stupid ass robotic invasion movies are nothing real so calm your ass and dont ever talk to me about this again.
also i think it's high time for government to launch policies for training supercomputers for every advanced AI developed just a suggestion to not be 
ruled by robots lol
