i always knew there was another something much bigger than maths, well there is a lot but something that we can understand or observe i mean, 
i called it symmetry bcs that was the most relevant thing i could think of bcs math at it's core is a symmetry blended system but that's just a 
math thing, math being 1+1=2, 2+2=2*2=2**2 and something just weirdly weird about this number that is only a math thing and i think last month i 
realised that this nature of math need not account for whole nther dimension, but there is something about it to consider, why number 2? co-incidence 
or well maybe not, fuck not nfkehfijea why is binary two? why is it 0 or 1 and not 0 or 1 or 2, i did talk about this before too but in a different pov 
before it was about the quantitative distribution for 0 and 1, that why it is 0 and 1 and not 0.3 and 1.45 or something or maybe its our norm like i also 
said before, maybe, no maybe, it is our norm, it is not 0 and 1, our world has the ratio so regularly that we have considered it as a norm, by norm i
mean 0 and 1 and by it i mean 0.3 and 1.45 crazy i love it i will leave some space to explain this later bcs now i have something much bigger to say 

yes so we change our pov now and move from dimension 0 to dimension umm 7 or 6, let's keep one for the physics and call it 7, better call 7, should 
physics be another dimension that is going to be another night i already talke dabout it before but not wnough, now 7th dimension. it is definitely 
fosho not symmetry, for symmetry is just a fucntion of math and bin bro wharrrrrrrrrrrrrrrujhgwdcj tf was that kjdhckjsb no fucking way symmetry is an 
object of dimension 6 and 0 i think this is the coolest thought i have had so far i really hope somebody readds this wtafffffffusdjuwihe guys i am having 
goosebumps wtffffffffff SYMMETRY, AN OBJECT OF DIMENSION 0 AND 6 AND NOT A FUCKING DIMENSION DUMBASS BITCH coolest fucking thoguht anybody could ever have 
and if you get it you dont get it, i have come to this conclusion now and not earlier bcs it took a lot of thought into it, it is not as superficial as you 
think it is, to get to here you should be good enough to believe that symmetry is the 7th dim and be sure enough as hell and fight and bloodshed and only 
after that i can maybe a little bit convince you of why it is not another dimension, if you do not argue and just believe and go by what is say and dont 
call it a piece of shit you probably dont understand it. i need my brain to calm down after creating literally the best thought ever i shall be a little 
narcisstic until then neuofj so yeah if you are a newbie to theoritical physics and philosophical sciences you better call my theories brainrot or 
senseless irrelevant pov of this world, but trust me when you look at everything this way the universe will start making a lot more sense and your life 
will keep getting more meaningless than ever, better death than survive but you wont want to die bcs these cool ass thoughts you want them to be forever 
yeah so lets get over the coolest thing anybody could ever think of and talk about 7th dimension, which which is rules! what rules? the rules to follow rules 
the rule to follow physics the rule for 3d objects the rule for lines the one single rule that rules all rules i sound like shakespear thu the mere fact that 
the any object is being the way governed by it's respective dimensions, well our universe it is not switching to all-paint world and coming back, and all 
but basically this is a function of the physics dimension, physics dimension gets to decide that but not completely, bcs physics is following this rule of 
where and how it can be lets call it 'disobedient' and the ultimate dimension is maintaining this, ykw lets call rules patterns, the patterny behavior of 
this universe is what i am saying, the physics is being physics for this, and trust me the patterns are much deeper than what you are thinking, the patterns 
where you disobey other dimensions, where you obey other dimensions, these patterns, there definitely is an ultimate formula for our cosmos, the family of 
universe that belong to the same pattern rules, a small change in the pattern rule will change the entire structure of the universe, like 1+1=3 or anythign 
at all, what is the formula tho, our math definitly not enough to make it for sure, we will need a more generalised math where even 1+1=3 can be proven 
and 1+1=5 and this discovery i think will make us the superpower where you can maybe interpret the world, you get the formula for the pattern and you will 
know everything in this world ever, but consciousness? is it really infinity and boundless? not now or here not in this context it definitely is bound by 
all the dimensions our like no matter how hard i think i will never be able to think of a dimension higher than 7th and so maybe in that way, back to the 
formula, that one formula must be able to teach you why gravity attracts and not repels and why integration formulas are so complicated and also psychology
coolest fucking shit ever, for everything in this world (including consciousness) is bounded by one ultimatum super-power pattern we will call it ultron
ultron was my crush btw, i really hope these theories get me to something and everytime i think i am completely done w these theories and nothing much 
ponder-worthy is left w the world something strikes and i have these amazing thoughts all over again and goosebumps
