Is multiverse even real? god might be equal opportunity for things, not necessary we are the same we definitely take undeterminstic concrete actions 
to bring about any change/difference in the universe, not necessary that there is a world for each ofour decisions bcs thats completely and only 
dependent on choice, oh wait if not for a multiverse with similar nature and stuff there might be a multiverse that only accounts for the various 
and infinite possible laws of physics a universe can adopt, maths and so on, but again what has caused them to exist, like for the world to exists 
a conscious brain of a living organism percieves it and all the quantum physics things happen and the world exists okay the relativity and quantum 
physics are colliding here some what confused but ygduhfugrehd, yeah so for physics to behave a certain way or similarly for the rules of physics 
or maths to be, there must have been some heavenly soul perhaps god to make them absolute idk or maybe its just for the usual living beings again, 
maybe the physics maths and symmetry and all the rules were formulated only for the first living/conscious creature it is so discomforting that all 
of this the mere existence of something like consciousness and things without anything to umm make all this happen is so disturbing, like noway 
humans are the super power of the universe this note completely deviates from what i belive i dont want to believe this either but lets just take 
account of all possibilities, roger penrose's theory for concsiousness somewhat makes sense here like maybe there is certainity and the conscious 
mind decides which certainity it follows, maybe that but my mind is aching wtf is this, this is totally unacceptable my theory of 5th dimension 
consiousness then physics then maths was so much more exciting and i hate to think of anything otherwise moreover my theory/beliefs explains almost 
everything and also suffices everything perfectly but it need not be it, ayoooooooooo consciousness nothing at all! meaning time not another 
dimension no cant be like time integrated to form the the entire timescale of the universe is meaningless if concsiousness gives a single outcome 
only, and the whole point of consciousness ie uncertainty is defied if there is no freedom of choice and time is simply not a dimension it is 
literally time nobody knows what happens nobody can change the past and all of this is stupid and bs bcs time is definitely a dimension and hence 
proved there are inifinite outcomes of concsious actions each holding a universe of their own perfect lovely. But roger penrose man i like your 
theory will argue about it some other night when i am good enough maybe but definitely will cOnTeMpLaTe it XD, i only know the superficial 
idea but it is so interesting, wait the tubules or something in the head they are responsible for decision making or perception?
