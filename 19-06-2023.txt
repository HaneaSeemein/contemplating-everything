tf is particle even ejnriovo like why are we grouping a set of atoms or molecules into something and believing them to be one system, something physically
seperated need not be seperated for the quantum world? going deeper into this will give that the entire universe is one particle one thing composed of many
little things but why? why are particles made of smaller particles? for easy interaction with the consciousness? why do atoms exist afterall, the entire universe is
anyhow going to be one system or one particle to sound stunning. why is this discretion of the larger particle into smaller particles a thing, why are larger particles
made of little particles, why atoms why electrons why anything, definitely for infinite divese possibilities or outcomes for the consious interaction,
but if it really was for conscious interactions, why atoms again, why do particles as small as "quantum size" exist like anyway humans wouldn't interact much with them
except for technology or idk like sounds stupid if all the concept of atoms and molecules and electrons and "quantum particles" exist only for discovery and entertainment
if it really is like this then everything is made of something smaller and electrons are also made of something smaller and it might continue like this to inifinity
and if we delve deeper into the components or something, maybe then we can find a single core particle(the tinier particle i mean) that structures itself into various forms
to create charges and energies and all, cool and shit but sounds stupid(it is is chemistry df), well either way i am not going to stop believing in the science of consciousness
and this guy roger penrose he has a good physics for consciousness but i don't want to believe it bcs why is world a certain way when it can be many no wait that
was not his point wjqhudjeg can someone please talk to me about this i-i crying emoji looks nice in this font i-i i-i i-i somuch cry aaaaaa yes back to it the universal particle
no wait roger penrose man actually makes sense it is interesting but but but no sounds very cartoonish and silly but it makes sense and why is verything but the speeed of light
infinite? it is so disturbing also zekoalaisreal told me about these random particles in space that appear out of nowhere ie nothingness no energy nothing at all, they appararently
borrow energy from the future!!!!! well in my world pov hehehehhe i was so glad to hear this, like i always had this doubt of why is matter so constrained to 3-d now bae it is not
but why is it not very prominent ofc we dont interact w them much so they simply dont exist much i dont literally mean what i say nvm yes so bcs they lend energy from the future
they are 4-d matter and we are 3-d so hard for us to interact w them bcs so chancy, i shall sleep now. goodbye googoogaagagaa mwah
This universal particle nature only applies to general relativity, quantum physics implies not direcctly but hte way quantum physics is the particles are continuos
like a table is not an object a chair is not an object infact there is no object at all, not even an object is deterministic, maybe an atom is an object but no the classification doesn't
stop there maybe the infinitesimally small particle is the object, makes sense so everytime a quantum event occurs ie conscious interaction the wave of these objects are entangled
but why do why do set of objects create a system with certain probabilities, no what i said is wrong like no something about this is wrong, object in quantum physics, hopefully there is
some yt video on this i'll brb, no i was not wrong i am right the real object is the infinitesimally small object for the universwe that is how it is but for us keep reading
well even in that experiment where they strike a thin gold foil with some photons to observe some light pass through it, here the light is the OBJECT or the particle no wait can't be no fuck 
this weird object concept is making me question everything i have ever known about quantum physics, maybe object/system really is just the arrangement of various particles to create one outcome
the outcomes for us, the objects for us oh fck so so is the "OBJECT" not a physical object but a conscious object idk terms i am bad but damn objects exists for consciousness oh wait this only
leads us to the basic picture of quantum physics lol i literally overthought something i already knew, but the pov of consciousness to it is beautiful not pov mb the truth OBJECTS ARE NOT PHYSICAL
THEY ARE CONSCIOUSLY CREATED, somebody should teach me english or languages bcs this is crazy wtaf man i love quantum physics, just watched a YT video of Aaron O'Connel where he talked the obvious
nothing new or exclusive but the good part about these videos are their pov, the way they describe quantum physics what quantum physics shows them i can marry them just somebody genuinely interested in quantum physics is everything i have aked from god
